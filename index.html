      <article class="description">
        <p class="personal-info">I'm a brazilian (carioca) who canâ€™t neither dance nor play football, who loves dogs and gets along with people
          well(most of them).
          Although I've worked in many different industries and/or environments, I currently see myself as a Creative Product
          Owner/Manager with a solid experience as a MEAN fullstack web developer.</p>
        <h3>I'm currently looking to start a new adventure in 2019.</h3>
        <p class="professional-info">With more than 6 years experience in the market , I'm easy to adapt to different environments, a quick learner, with a
          diverse set of skills and good dosis of good will. I don't shy away from new challenges. I'd rather see them as
          opportunities to grow and learn something new. Throghout my carrer I coordinated +10 people team in both organized and
          hectic environments as well as worked with with short and mutable deadlines. In 2018 I entered the web development
          world where I'm not only learning but also having a blast.</p>
